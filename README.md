# Fidelity-Investments-for-Possible-Blockchain-Boost

Cryptocurrencies did not take as much flight as expected. This year, prices of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ether (via Ethereum blockchain) plummeted as they met with tougher times.This is mostly because it failed to lure retailers to accept it as payment method, and as its regulators become tighter, the masses also don’t quite get the grip.


But Fidelity Investments, one of the largest retail investments services firms in the United States, hold so much promise in changing the situation. According to Forbes, this week, Fidelity investments “announced it was creating a stand-alone company that is focused solely on bringing cryptocurrency trading to institutional investors. Dubbed Fidelity Digital Assets, the company will offer institutional investors custody services, a cryptocurrency platform and advising to its institutional clients”.


It’s not just selling to retail investors. What Fidelity is doing could greatly assist in boosting the credibility of cryptocurrencies and eventually, it may push through with regular investors. 

Fidelity’s focus is still on the institutional side of cryptocurrencies. Jason Davis, Chief Executive of Hoard, a cryptocurrency company, said it's only a matter of time before cryptocurrency trickles down to the retail investors just like any other investment products.
